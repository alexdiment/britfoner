_Britfoner_ is an api for translating English words to their phonetic form (in British English). It uses
phonetic dictionary [_Britfone_](https://github.com/JoseLlarena/Britfone) as a first lookup and a Keras+Tensorflow
grapheme-to-phoneme converter (trained also  on _Britfone_) as a backup.

_Britfoner_ incorporates code from [seq2seq](https://github.com/farizrahman4u/seq2seq) and [recurrentshop](https://github.com/farizrahman4u/recurrentshop)

_Britfoner_ is limited to words 18 characters and less.

## <a name="more-background"></a>Background

_Britfoner_ maps English words to their pronunciations as per the [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet).
It looks up a word (matching `[A-Za-z ']+`) in [_Britfone_](https://github.com/JoseLlarena/Britfone), a British English
pronunciation dictionary, returning the possible pronunciations. If the word is not found, it uses a Keras Deep Learning
(with a Tensorflow backend) model as a backup.

The model is a [Sequence to Sequence model with Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473), with a single-layered 256-hidden-unit bidirectional-encoder and decoder.
It was trained on 16,042 unaligned word-pronunciation pairs, using 163 pairs for validation (99%/1% split), for 220 epochs (1 1/2 hours on a 
i5+GTX1050 GPU), with the Adam
optimiser, learning rate 10<sup>-2</sup>, decay 10<sup>-5</sup> and 10% dropout. The output is unnormalised, the loss is mean squared error and
the output is decoded with a greedy strategy. The final word error rate was 15.95%.
